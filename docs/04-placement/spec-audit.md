# Placement Cell — specification audit

The Placement module measured against the PCMS specification set **v1.3 FINAL**
(`Fusion/17-Placement Cell/`). Every finding below was checked against the code,
not inferred from a citation: a comment naming a rule proves only that somebody
typed its id.

## What the specification contains

| Artefact | Active | Retired by the spec |
|---|---|---|
| Business rules | **26** | 4 — `PC-BR-008`, `018`, `027`, `028` |
| Use cases | **22** | 2 — `PC-UC-018`, `019` |
| Workflows | 8 basis + 4 composite | legacy `PC-WF-001` … `008` |
| Requirements | 19 consolidated (CFR), 64 atomic (AFR) | — |

The retirements are deliberate and explained in the documents. Two of the retired
rules still describe behaviour the module must have — they were retired because
they duplicate a requirement, not because the behaviour was dropped:

- `PC-BR-008` application history → now **PC-AFR-009**
- `PC-BR-018` announcement history → now **PC-AFR-043**
- `PC-UC-018` role-scoped access → now cross-cutting, **PC-BR-022** / **PC-AFR-061**

The traceability matrix's mapping columns (`Mapped UC(s)`, `Mapped BR(s)`) are
empty in the file, so requirement coverage below was established by reading
each requirement, not by trusting the matrix.

## Summary

| | Implemented | Partial | Missing | Deviation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Business rules (26) | 24 | 1 (`029`) | 1 (`019`) | — |
| Use cases (22) | 18 | 2 (`010`, `024`) | 1 (`017`) | 1 (`014`) |
| Requirements (64) | 55 | 5 | 3 | 1 (`044`) |

**Traceability is weaker than the implementation.** 6 rules and 5 use cases are
built but never cited; 2 use-case ids are cited for the wrong thing; 24 citations
point at retired ids; and no code cites a v1.3 workflow at all.

## 1. Genuine gaps — work to do

### G1. Alumni cannot reach the module at all
`PC-UC-017`, `PC-BR-019`, `PC-AFR-058`, `PC-AFR-059` · **missing**

`selectors/scoping.py` handles an `alumni` role carefully — a read-only slice,
and exclusion from every active workflow object. But nothing lets an alumnus in:
the placement registry grants the module to no alumni role, and the identity
service has no alumni kind. The scoping code is correct and unreachable.

`PC-BR-020` / `PC-AFR-060` (alumni kept *out* of active workflows) is satisfied,
but only trivially, because no alumnus can arrive to be kept out.

Needs a decision before code: how an alumnus is identified (an IAM kind, a
designation, or graduated students by batch), and what the mentorship slice
actually shows.

### G2. A company cannot register itself
`PC-UC-014`, `PC-AFR-044` · **deviation**

The spec's actor is the Company/Recruiter, submitting its own registration for
institute approval. In the code, `services/companies.py::register` requires the
TPO's `manage` permission, and recruiters arrive only by TPO invitation. The
approval gate (`PC-BR-007`, `PC-AFR-045`) is sound; what is missing is the
company-initiated front door.

This may be the right call for the institute — an open registration form is an
abuse surface — but it departs from the document and should be decided, not
inherited.

### G3. The TPO cannot correct a placement record
`PC-UC-010`, `PC-BR-029`, `PC-AFR-031`, `PC-AFR-032` · **partial / missing**

What exists: records are written on offer acceptance (`PC-BR-014`), the TPO can
record an off-campus placement, and a student can declare not joining or submit
an offer letter. What does not: any way for the TPO to *update* an existing
record — a wrong CTC, a company correction, a deactivation — and any record
handling for alumni (`PC-AFR-032`).

The one `PC-BR-029` citation (`domain/state_machine.py`) is about offer
revocation going through the TPO, which is related but is not this rule.

### G4. Reports stop at one season
`PC-AFR-034`, `PC-AFR-035`, `PC-AFR-036`, `PC-AFR-016` · **partial**

`services/stats.py` gives, per season: placement rate (`PC-AFR-033` ✓), a
by-company breakdown, a by-discipline breakdown, and median / mean / max CTC.

- **Company participation *trend*** (`034`) and **employment *trend*** (`036`)
  need figures across seasons. Nothing compares seasons.
- **Salary package *distribution*** (`035`) is three summary numbers, not a
  distribution. Bands would answer it, subject to the existing small-cell floor.
- **Historical data for students** (`016`): the API accepts `?season=`, but
  the Reports page has no season picker, so a student cannot reach a past season.

## 2. Implemented, but nothing points at it

Traceability only — the behaviour is there.

| Id | What it is | Where it actually lives |
|---|---|---|
| `PC-BR-005` | TPO posting authority | `services/postings.py` — writes require `manage` |
| `PC-BR-022` | Role-restricted access | module grant + permission codes + `selectors/scoping.py` |
| `PC-BR-024` | Sensitive-data modify restriction | `services/authz.py::require` on every write path |
| `PC-BR-025` | Academic master data stays external | CPI read from the IAM projection, never computed here |
| `PC-BR-026` | Auth / RBAC stays external | `fusion_auth` + the identity service |
| `PC-BR-030` | No external selection decisions | outcomes are recorded from TPO or company actions only |
| `PC-UC-004` | Student tracks status | application history, offers, placement records |
| `PC-UC-007` | Automated notifications | notification outbox; all seven events in `PC-AFR-050`–`056` |
| `PC-UC-021` | Company schedules an interview | `services/interviews.py` admits recruiters |
| `PC-UC-022` | Company extends an offer | `services/offers.py` admits recruiters |
| `PC-UC-023` | Resume from profile | **deviation** — the resume is maintained on the ERP portal, see §6 |
| `PC-UC-024` | Student statistics | `services/stats.py::student_view`, cited only as `PC-BR-016` — **partial**: past seasons unreachable from the UI, see G4 |

All seven notification events were confirmed individually: posting published,
application submitted, shortlisted, rejected, interview scheduled, offer issued,
announcement published.

All six states in `PC-AFR-010` exist: submitted, shortlisted, interview
scheduled, offer issued, offer accepted, offer declined.

## 3. Citations that point at the wrong thing

The code was written against an earlier use-case numbering.

| Cited as | Means in v1.3 | Should be | Sites |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PC-UC-002` | Browse opportunities | `PC-UC-023` resume | resolved — those sites were deleted with the profile, see §6 |
| `PC-UC-016` | Company shortlists | `PC-UC-022` extend offer | 1 — `services/offers.py` |

Meanwhile the real `PC-UC-016` (company shortlisting) is implemented as the
review transitions in `domain/state_machine.py`, which admit both the TPO and the
owning company — and cite neither.

## 4. Citations to retired ids

| Retired id | Sites | Repoint to |
|---|---|---|
| `PC-BR-008` | 7 — audit trail model, API, serializer, test, client drawer and hooks | `PC-AFR-009` |
| `PC-BR-018` | 3 — announcement model, service, scoping | `PC-AFR-043` |
| `PC-UC-018` | 1 — `selectors/scoping.py` | `PC-BR-022` |
| `PC-WF-001` … `008` | 13 | the matching `BW-PC-nn` / `CW-PC-nn` |

No code cites a v1.3 basis or composite workflow.

## 5. Confirmed implemented

Checked against the code, not just the citation.

| Id | Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `PC-BR-001` | Profile completeness before applying | answered by the ERP portal's `profile_completed`, enforced in `services/applications.py` — see §6 |
| `PC-BR-002` | Eligibility before applying | `domain/eligibility.py`; criteria frozen on publish |
| `PC-BR-003` | Posting content required | model constraint plus a data migration |
| `PC-BR-004` | Eligibility vocabulary | closed vocabulary — an unknown field denies |
| `PC-BR-006` | Company posting authority | `services/postings.py` |
| `PC-BR-007` | Company approval gate | `approval_status`, `can_operate` |
| `PC-BR-009` | Company sees only its own applications | `selectors/scoping.py` |
| `PC-BR-010` | TPO manages applications | review transitions in `domain/state_machine.py` |
| `PC-BR-011` | Interview date, slot, mode | required fields on `InterviewRound` |
| `PC-BR-012` | Interview notification | `services/interviews.py` enqueues on adding candidates |
| `PC-BR-013` | Offer response deadline | expiry task on a five-minute beat |
| `PC-BR-014` | Record written on acceptance | `services/offers.py` |
| `PC-BR-015` | Multiple-offer policy | `domain/offer_policy.py` |
| `PC-BR-016` | Anonymised student statistics | small-cell floor in `services/stats.py` |
| `PC-BR-017` | Announcement topics bounded | fixed topic choices |
| `PC-BR-020` | Alumni kept out of active workflows | `selectors/scoping.py` — trivially, see G1 |
| `PC-BR-021` | Email hand-off | notification outbox and delivery worker |
| `PC-BR-023` | Sensitive data view restriction | CPI directory permission-gated |

Use cases `001`, `002`, `003`, `005`, `006`, `008`, `009`, `011`, `012`, `013`,
`015`, `016` and `020` are implemented as specified. `PC-UC-012` includes
company participation (`companies_participated` and the by-company breakdown).

## Suggested order

1. **Fix traceability (§2–§4).** Mechanical and safe, and it makes every later
   finding checkable. Worth a generated reference page, as for ELM.
2. **G3 — record corrections.** Smallest real gap, and a wrong placement record
   is a live data-quality problem.
3. **G4 — trends, distribution, season picker.** Contained to stats and the
   Reports page.
4. **G1 and G2 need decisions first** — who counts as an alumnus, and whether
   companies may register themselves. Neither should be built on a guess.

---

## 6. The placement profile was removed

The module used to keep its own student profile — headline, about, skills,
documents and a completeness percentage — and a resume uploaded into it. The
ERP portal already holds all of that on its own profile page, so a student
maintained two, and only the placement one gated applying.

**What changed.** `StudentProfile`, `services/profiles.py` and
`domain/profile_completeness.py` are gone. The resume and the completion flag
are projected from the portal through the IAM into `modules/directory`, and
placement reads them like any other person fact. Recruiters see the resume on
the applicant row rather than behind a separate profile page.

**What this means for the specification.**

| Id | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `PC-BR-001` | completeness computed here | the portal's `profile_completed`; the rule still holds, the answer comes from upstream |
| `PC-UC-001` | student maintains a placement profile | **deviation** — one profile, on the portal |
| `PC-UC-023` | a structured resume derived from the profile | **deviation** — a link the student maintains upstream, not generated data |

**What was deliberately kept.** `ProfileDocument` survives, detached from the
profile and keyed by `user_id` alone. It holds offer letters and clearance
paperwork, which are placement's own and duplicate nothing — deleting it with
the profile would have destroyed them. Its `resume` kind is gone.

**Eligibility lost the `skills` criterion**, which had no source once the
profile went; the IAM does not project skills. No posting used it. The
`LIST_FIELDS` machinery stays, because a closed vocabulary is meant to be
added to.
