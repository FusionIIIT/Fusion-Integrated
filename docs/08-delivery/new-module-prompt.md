# New module — the starting prompt

One module is already built to this shape: `modules/placement` — the reference. A new
module that does not look like it is a defect, not a style choice.

**How to use this:** copy everything from the `--- PROMPT BEGINS ---` line to the
`--- PROMPT ENDS ---` line into a fresh session. Fill in the six blanks — `[MODULE_NAME]`,
`[SPEC_FOLDER_PATH]`, `[ID_PREFIX]`, `[module_code]`, `[ENVIRONMENT]` and `[NN]` — everywhere
they appear, not only in §0; §1's reading list depends on `[ENVIRONMENT]`. Do not summarise it, do
not trim it — the length is what keeps modules identical. Every phase below is a numbered
sequence of steps — work top to bottom, do not skip ahead, and do not start a phase's
steps before the previous phase's approval gate (where one exists) has actually cleared.

**It comes with a second prompt.** [`module-review-prompt.md`](module-review-prompt.md) is how
the result is judged: a fresh session that did not build the module, ideally on a different
model, re-runs every gate itself and scores the module 0–10 on nine dimensions. The module is
finished when a review made after the last code change scores 10 in all nine (§10).

---

--- PROMPT BEGINS ---

## §0 — The job

Build the **[MODULE_NAME]** module in `Fusion-Integrated`, from its specification set at
**[SPEC_FOLDER_PATH]**, to the same standard and the same shape as the existing
`modules/placement` module.

### Step 0.1 — Confirm what you are building

- Specification id prefixes: **[ID_PREFIX]** (e.g. `PC-BR-`, `PC-UC-` for Placement).
- Module code / URL segment: **[module_code]** (lowercase, singular-ish, no underscores).
- Environment: **[ENVIRONMENT]** — `full-platform` or `module-only` (Step 0.2).
- Docs folder: **`docs/[NN]-[module_code]/`**, with `[NN]` as given by whoever assigned the
  module.

This is production code for an institute that will run it for years. "The tests pass" is
not the finish line — §8 is, and after it §10: an independent review that scores the module
10/10 on every dimension. What you hand over is merged and deployed as it stands; nobody
rewrites it after you, so build the final version, not a draft. Work in phases. **Do not write a line of application code
before Phase 2 is approved by me.**

### Rules that sit above every step in this document

Six rules sit above everything else here, because everything else is negotiable and these
are not. They are not a step in the sequence — they apply at every step, in every phase.

**Stop and report, do not proceed, when:** a required file or spec document is missing or
unreachable; two spec documents contradict each other; a spec rule and the platform's
architecture conflict (§9 restates this — it is here because it is the most common case);
or you would otherwise have to guess the intended behaviour rather than read it. Guessing
and building on the guess is the failure mode every incident this document describes traces back to
in the end. Report the specific thing that is missing or contradictory; do not reconstruct
what you think was probably meant.

**The one conflict you resolve yourself, silently, no exception:** if following the spec or
matching the reference modules would weaken security or cross a data-isolation boundary —
expose one person's rows to another, skip a permission gate, write to `fusionlab`, add a
credential to a tracked file — refuse it and say why. This is the only priority ordering in
this document; it does not extend to architecture-vs-spec disagreements, which are always
escalated, never decided.

**Evidence, not belief.** Never report a check as passing unless you ran it in this session,
after your last change to the code it covers, and can quote the command and the last lines of
its real output. "Should pass", "I expect this works" and "the tests would pass" are not
results. If you cannot run something — a service is down, a tool is missing — say exactly
that. An honest "not run" is an open item; a guessed "passes" is a false report, and it costs
more than the failure it hid.

**No placeholders.** No `TODO`, `FIXME`, `pass`-only bodies, `NotImplementedError`, hard-coded
sample data in the UI, commented-out code or "to be implemented" anywhere in the diff.
Something you cannot finish is a known gap in the blueprint's Step 3.8 (h) that I have
accepted — never a stub that looks finished.

**Resuming in a new session.** If you are given an approved blueprint and a note on where the
last session stopped, read §1's files again, skip Phases 1 and 2, and continue at the step the
note names. Re-run every gate before you claim anything; nothing a previous session reported
counts as evidence for this one.

**Which document wins.** `definition-of-done.md` and `docs/06-crosscutting/testing-strategy.md`
describe the platform's target and name some tools, files and thresholds this repository does
not have yet — Playwright, axe-core, size-limit, hypothesis, MSW, schemathesis, mutmut,
`django-migration-linter`, `ops/db/roles.sql`, `modules/leave/`. **This prompt governs.** The
items from `definition-of-done.md` that still apply are already folded into the steps below;
anything there this prompt does not state does not apply. Do not add a missing tool to satisfy
it: that is a new dependency, and needs approval like any other (Step 7.7).

**Who approves, when this is an assignment.** If a mentor assigned you this module, every
approval this prompt asks for — the blueprint (Step 3.8), each known gap, each change outside
your module's own folders, each new dependency — is the mentor's, given in writing. The
person typing to you can relay it, not grant it. Record each approval in the quality report
(Step 7.9) as a link to, or a dated quote of, that written approval. An approval with no
record does not count.

### Step 0.2 — Determine which environment you are building in

Two shapes exist, and they are not a spectrum. Step 0.1 tells you which one you are in; do not
go looking through folders you were not given to find out.

**`full-platform`** — `Fusion`, `Fusion-client`, `Fusion_System_Administrator` and
`Fusion-Integrated` all checked out, `fusionlab` restored from a production dump or the full
dev fixture. This is the platform lead's machine. §1's shell-reading list is read as written.

**`module-only`** — only `Fusion_System_Administrator` and `Fusion-Integrated`, and
`fusionlab` restored from nothing but the public `fusion-dev.dump` (`Fusion-README`). This is
the lab. Four things follow, all through the rest of this document:

- **No `Fusion-client`, no `Fusion` (legacy) checkout, ever.** §1 names two files that live
  only in `Fusion-client`; do not try to read them — they are not on this machine. The
  self-contained contract is given in §1 instead of the file paths, so nothing about your
  module's correctness depends on that repo existing here.
- **Fusion-Integrated's own `client/` is the complete way to build and demo a module.** It
  runs standalone (`make dev` + `cd client && npm run dev`), needs no portal, and is not a
  fallback — it is where you will do all of Phase 5 either way. What you cannot do here is
  see your module framed inside the real sidebar; that is a `full-platform`-only check, in
  Step 6.6, and it is fine to defer it.
- **`fusionlab` is a fixture, not the ERP.** It carries the ~19 tables `fusion-dev.dump`
  ships (`auth_user`, `globals_*`, `programme_curriculum_{batch,course,curriculum,
  discipline,programme}`, the examination and grade tables — check `\dt` if in doubt) and
  nothing else. A field the IAM projects can legitimately be empty here — an academic
  standing, a resume link, a department — because the synthetic data does not populate it,
  not because your code is wrong. Write for that: never let an absent optional field 500 a
  request. `iam/erp_source.py::all_student_profiles` is the concrete example — it now reads
  two tables this fixture does not carry, and skips each independently rather than failing
  the whole projection.
- **A role your spec needs that the fixture does not have is yours to provision, not to wait
  on.** There is no academic office in a lab. One command in `Fusion_System_Administrator`
  creates and assigns it — see the bullet "Requesting a new role and provisioning one for
  your own testing are different acts" in Step 3.4. Nothing about this needs
  `Fusion-client`.

---

## §1 — Phase 0: read, before anything else

Read these in this order and do not skim. You are being asked to match an existing house
style precisely, and you cannot match what you have not read.

### Step 1.1 — Read the platform's own rules

- `docs/01-architecture/adr/` — every ADR. `0013` (no cross-module FKs), `0010`
  (server-driven navigation), `0002` (separate IAM service and database) and `0006`
  (outbox + Celery) constrain your design directly.
- `docs/03-platform/platform-structure.md` — the layering rules.
- `docs/03-platform/shared-kernel-reference.md` — what may and may not go in `core/`.
- `docs/06-crosscutting/testing-strategy.md` and `security-baseline.md`.
- `docs/08-delivery/definition-of-done.md`.
- `.importlinter` — the four contracts. These are enforced by CI, not advisory.
- `Makefile` — specifically the `check` target. That list is the contract with CI.

`docs/03-platform/module-authoring-guide.md` has drifted from the code (it names paths and
a `make new-module` target that no longer exist). Read it for intent; trust the code and
this document for shape. If you spot a specific drift, list it at the end of Step 1.4 — do
not fix it mid-task.

### Step 1.2 — Read the reference implementations

- `modules/placement/` — the shape you are copying. It is too large to read whole without
  crowding out this prompt, so read these files in full: `registry.py`, `contracts.py`,
  `schedule.py`, `domain/state_machine.py`, `domain/clearance.py`, `selectors/scoping.py`,
  `services/offers.py`, `api/permissions.py`, and from `tests/` `test_privilege_escalation.py`,
  `test_recruiter_isolation.py`, `test_query_budgets.py` and `test_schedule.py`. List the
  rest of the folder, and open another file only when a step needs it. For the browser tests,
  read `client/e2e/support/test.ts`, `client/e2e/accounts.ts`, `client/e2e/auth.spec.ts`,
  `client/e2e/placement/companies.spec.ts` and `client/e2e/placement/office-pages.spec.ts`,
  and the E2E section of `docs/06-crosscutting/testing-strategy.md`. For closing a page to
  the roles it is not for, read `client/src/auth/RequirePermission.tsx`, the `office()` helper
  in `client/src/modules/placement/routes.tsx` and
  `modules/placement/tests/test_client_route_guards.py` (Step 6.4). `domain/clearance.py`
  and `services/offers.py` show the choke-point pattern you will need even if your module has
  nothing like them.
- Two things in Placement predate the rules below; do not copy them. Its `MODULE["code"]` is
  `placement_cell`, which differs from its folder and URL segment — yours is `[module_code]`
  in all four places and as the permission prefix. And some of its permission verbs
  (`view_self`, `self`, `respond`, `issue`, `expire`, `debar`, `schedule`, `auto_withdraw`)
  are outside the closed list in
  `docs/02-iam/rbac-model.md` — use that list. Its multi-line docstrings also predate the
  one-line comment rule (§4); do not copy them.
- `core/` in full — `api/exceptions.py`, `api/pagination.py`, `api/csrf.py`,
  `api/throttling.py`, `db/mixins.py`. Anything already here you must reuse, not reinvent.
- `client/src/modules/placement/` — the frontend shape.

### Step 1.3 — Read the shell you are plugging into

This app draws no sidebar of its own. `Fusion-client` is the shell for every Fusion module
and owns the sidebar, the header and the role switcher; your module contributes pages and
nothing else. What you read depends on §0 Step 0.2's environment:

**Always — this repo, always present:**
- `client/src/app/Shell.tsx` — `isEmbedded()`. Framed pages render only `<Outlet/>`; nothing
  else about the shell exists in this repo, and nothing here requires `Fusion-client`:
  ```ts
  export function isEmbedded(): boolean {
    // Being framed is the reliable signal; an internal redirect drops the query.
    try {
      if (window.self !== window.top) return true;
    } catch {
      return true;                 // cross-origin parent; only a frame can throw
    }
    return new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("embed") === "1";
  }
  ```
- `Fusion_System_Administrator/Backend/backend/iam/services.py` — `modules_by_designation`
  and `navigation_by_designation`. Both the module list and the sidebar are split **per
  designation**; a person acting as one role must never see another role's screens. The IAM
  is present in both environments.

**`full-platform` only:**
- `Fusion-client/src/ui/nav/navigation.js` — how a plugged module is placed and expanded, and
  where `INTEGRATED_MODULES` lives: a **hand-maintained array**, one entry per module
  (`id`, `label`, `icon`, `to`, `section`), separate from anything your `registry.py`
  publishes. Seeding the IAM makes your module *grantable*; it does not make it appear in the
  real sidebar. That needs this one entry added, by whoever has this repo checked out. Record
  the exact fields for it in the blueprint's Step 3.5 (e) so it is ready to hand over — in
  `module-only`, this is the one piece of your module you cannot finish yourself.
- `Fusion-client/src/ui/routing/PluggedModule.jsx` — the iframe that frames your pages and
  appends `?embed=1`.

In `module-only`, treat both of those as read about, not read: this section already tells
you what they do. Verify everything else through this repo's own `client/`, which needs
neither of them.

### Step 1.4 — Read and inventory the specification

Read every document in the spec folder. Build an inventory before you interpret anything:

1. How many business rules exist, and **which ids the spec explicitly retires**. Retired ids
   are a trap: some retirements moved the behaviour to a requirement id rather than dropping
   the behaviour. Record which is which.
2. How many use cases, and which are retired.
3. The workflow ids (basis and composite) and their current naming.
4. The requirement ids, if the spec has a separate requirements layer.
5. Whether the traceability matrix's mapping columns are actually populated. If they are
   empty, say so and derive coverage by reading each rule — never by trusting the matrix.
6. **Every actor named anywhere in the business rules, use cases, and workflows** — this
   inventory is what Step 2.4 builds the role list from if no role list is handed to you
   directly, so build it carefully here even if you think you already know the roles.

### Step 1.5 — Report back

At the end of Phase 0, tell me: the artefact counts, the retired ids with their
replacements, any internal contradiction between two spec documents, and any rule that
cannot be implemented as written. **Do not invent an id that the spec does not contain**,
and do not cite a retired id as if it were live.

---

## §2 — Phase 1: the questions that must be answered before code

Some specs are written against assumptions Fusion does not hold. Surface these now, not in
review. Answer what you can from the code; ask me the rest as a short numbered list.

### Step 2.1 — Is this one bounded context?

If the answer is "mostly", it is two modules.

### Step 2.2 — What does it need from other modules?

Every answer becomes a function on *their* `contracts.py`, agreed with them. A long list
means the boundary is wrong.

### Step 2.3 — Identity

Fusion's identity lives in a *different database*, reached over HTTP
(`fusion_auth/client.py`), projected locally by `modules/directory`. If a spec says
"foreign key to Employee" or "request.user.employee", it is describing a system we do
not have. Every person reference in your module is a **plain integer `user_id`**
(`core/db/mixins.py::UserScopedModel`). No exceptions.

### Step 2.4 — Who decides, and who may see

List every role in the spec and map it to a designation as it actually exists in
`globals_designation`, plus the basic `student` / `faculty` / `staff` kinds.

- **If the role list is given to you** — by the spec, by whoever assigned you the module, or
  by me directly — use it as given. Do not second-guess a given role list against the use
  cases; that is relitigating a decision that was already made.
- **If it is not given to you, derive it yourself** from the actor inventory you built in
  Step 1.4.6: read every business rule, use case, and workflow document, and list every
  actor named as performing or approving a step — "the coordinator reviews",
  "the employee submits", "HR escalates" each name a role. Build the role list from that
  inventory, not from guessing what a module like this "usually" needs. **Cite the BR/UC/
  workflow id next to every role you derive this way** — a role with no citation is a role
  you invented, not one you read.
- Either way, a role the IAM cannot express is a blocker, not a detail. Surface it here, in
  Phase 1's questions — do not quietly invent a designation that does not exist in
  `globals_designation`, and do not carry an unresolved role into Step 3.4's permission list.

### Step 2.5 — Scope

For each read endpoint: whose rows does this person see? The answer becomes
queryset narrowing in `selectors/scoping.py`, which yields **404, never 403** — a 403
confirms the row exists to someone who should not know that.

### Step 2.6 — Time

Does anything expire, escalate, credit annually, or advance on a date? That is
a Celery beat entry in `schedule.py`, and beat *must* be running in production. If
nothing in the module needs a clock, say so explicitly.

### Step 2.7 — Money / quota / balance

If the module counts anything a person can spend, it is an **append-only ledger**, not a
balance column. Corrections are reversing entries, never an edit to a past row.

### Step 2.8 — Policy

Anything an administrator configures is **effective-dated and never edited** — superseded by
a new version. A module with no seeded policy must not 500 on first use; it must say what is
missing, and that gap belongs in the blueprint's Step 3.8 (h) open questions.

---

## §3 — Phase 2: the blueprint (deliverable, needs my approval)

Write `docs/[NN]-[module_code]/[module_code]-blueprint.md` **before any code**. Each step
below is one section of that document, in this order.

### Step 3.1 (a) — Traceability table

One row per live business rule, use case, workflow and requirement id:

| Id | What it requires | Layer it belongs in | Enforcement point (planned) | Notes |

The "layer" column is the design decision. A rule that lands in `api/` is almost always
misplaced — API is transport, not policy.

### Step 3.2 (b) — Domain model

Entities, their fields, their invariants. Name the constraints you will push into the
database (`UniqueConstraint`, `CheckConstraint`, partial unique indexes) as opposed to
enforcing in Python. Anything that must hold under concurrency belongs in the database.

### Step 3.3 (c) — State machine, if the module has one

A **declarative transition table** — a data structure listing (state, event, actor) → state.
Not a chain of `if` statements. An illegal transition must be *inexpressible*, not merely
rejected.

### Step 3.4 (d) — Permission list

The exact `registry.py` content: `MODULE`, `PERMISSIONS`, `SYSTEM_PERMISSIONS` (bare
strings, for scheduled work no human holds), `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS`, and `ROLE_GRANTS` keyed
by real designation names, built from Step 2.4's role list (given or derived — either way,
every role here should trace back to that step, with citations if it was derived).

**Settle this before writing Step 3.4.** Your module defines **permissions**. It does not
define roles, and it owns no access-control table of any kind. Three databases, three
owners, nothing duplicated:

| Database | Owns | Your module |
|---|---|---|
| `fusionlab` (ERP) | people, and which designations they hold | never writes it, never queries it |
| `fusion_system_db` (IAM) | designation → permission, designation → module, module → nav | seeds rows into it, through the manifest only |
| `fusion_integrated` | your business tables | yours, and **no auth tables in it** |

If you find yourself adding a `Role`, `Permission`, `UserRole` or `ModuleAccess` model, stop:
that table already exists in the IAM and a second copy is the thing this architecture exists
to prevent. The same applies if your module is told to live in `fusionlab` under its own
schema — where the *business* tables sit has no bearing on this; RBAC is the IAM's either way.

Rules that follow from it:

- **Roles are institute-wide, not per-module.** `ROLE_GRANTS` is keyed by designation names
  exactly as `globals_designation` spells them — they are the join key, so a typo is a grant
  that silently reaches nobody. Copy the spelling from the ERP, do not retype it.
- **`student`, `faculty` and `staff` are held by definition**, not assigned, and carry no ERP
  row. Grant to them directly when a permission belongs to everyone of that kind.
- **Requesting a new role and provisioning one for your own testing are different acts.**
  Whether the institute should have a "Grievance Officer" post is not yours to decide —
  raise it as an open question in Step 3.8 (h), and in production it is created in the ERP by
  the academic office. But you still need that designation to *exist* to test against it, in
  either environment, and waiting on the academic office is not how you do that in dev.

  The write path is `Fusion_System_Administrator`'s own management command, never a database
  edit, exactly as `role-assignment-guide.md` Part 5 shows: from
  `<absolute path to Fusion_System_Administrator>/Backend/backend`, run
  `./../venv/bin/python manage.py assign_role --user <dump username> --designation "<name>"`
  (`--remove` takes it away). Log that account out and back in, and the role is live in its
  session. The grant is written into the ERP itself, so it lasts through every later refresh
  and `sync_identity` run until you remove it. This works identically in `full-platform` and
  `module-only`; it needs neither
  `Fusion-client` nor a real institute. Use a role the institute does not have only once its
  open question has an answer from whoever assigned you the module.
- **Granting a module is a visibility decision.** Do not grant your module to a role "so they
  can look" — it puts your module in that role's sidebar permanently.
- **Permissions are `<module_code>.<singular_noun>.<verb>`**, the verb from the closed list in
  `docs/02-iam/rbac-model.md`. `manage` is an escape hatch; expect to justify it.
- **Only the acting role counts.** Somebody holding two designations gets the permissions of
  one of them at a time, and the sidebar is built per role from that role's own grants. Design
  for the role, never for the person.
- **Permissions decide the verb, scoping decides the rows.** A coordinator limited to one
  department holds the *same* permissions as an unlimited one; the difference lives in
  `selectors/scoping.py`. Never encode a scope as a permission.
- **Publishing is two steps, and the second is the one people forget.** `make permissions`
  writes `registry/permissions.json`; the IAM only applies it when
  `seed_iam_permissions --manifest <path>` runs. Seeding is authoritative for the modules the
  manifest names — a grant you delete is revoked — and scoped to your publisher, so it cannot
  disturb another service's grants. Read what it prints; it names every revoke.

### Step 3.5 (e) — Endpoint list

Method, path under `/api/v1/[module_code]/`, the two gates it sits behind, what it returns,
and which rule ids it enforces. In `module-only`, also write the `Fusion-client` sidebar
entry this module needs (`id`, `label`, `icon`, `to`, `section`) — you cannot add it
yourself, so it must be a clean, complete instruction someone else can paste into
`INTEGRATED_MODULES` without guessing.

For every client route, also write down how it is guarded (Step 6.4): the permission that
`RequirePermission` checks, or why the page is for every role the module is granted.

Every client route must have a nav item, and every nav item a route —
`ops/checks/nav_matches_routes.py` fails CI otherwise. So a record's detail opens in a drawer
or a modal on its list page, the way Placement's `HistoryDrawer` and `IssueOfferModal` do,
not on a route of its own.

### Step 3.6 (f) — Contracts

What `modules/[module_code]/contracts.py` will expose to other modules, and what you need
added to theirs. Every getter is **plural** — `get_x(ids: Sequence[int])` — because a
singular getter is the one that ends up inside a loop
(`ops/checks/contracts_are_plural.py` enforces this).

Your module will need things the ERP owns: a CPI, a department, a batch, the staff
directory. It reads none of them from `fusionlab`. The IAM holds the only connection to
that database, as unmanaged models, and exposes what it projects:

| You need | Ask | Never |
|---|---|---|
| who this is, what they may do | the session on the request | — |
| a person's name, kind, discipline | `get_users`, `search_users` | a join to `auth_user` |
| a student's CPI or result standing | `get_academic_standings` | reading the grade tables |
| the student or staff directory | `academic_directory`, `iter_employees` | a second database alias |
| your own data | your models in `fusion_integrated` | — |

If the field you need is not exposed, **the deliverable is an addition to the IAM's
projection and API**, listed here in Step 3.6 as a dependency — not a `fusionlab` connection
from your module. Two reasons, and the second is the one that bites: a module with that
connection can write to the ERP, so the ERP ends up with two writers and no owner; and the
moment two services compute the same fact from the same rows, the institute has two answers
to a question that has one. Placement's eligibility rule needs a CPI and asks for it; it does
not know which tables a CPI is made of, and that is deliberate.

Never add an `IamClient` method — nor its `FakeIam` twin — for an endpoint the IAM's `main`
does not already have. The tests would pass against the fake and production would answer 404.
A dependency on a missing IAM endpoint is a stop: report it to whoever assigned you the module.

In `module-only`, expect every one of these calls to answer with less than `full-platform`
would give — `fusion-dev.dump` is a fixture, not the ERP, and a sparse answer is correct
behaviour for it. Test the absent case deliberately; do not treat "it returned nothing on my
machine" as a bug to route around.

### Step 3.7 (g) — Scheduled work

Each beat entry, its cadence, and what breaks in the real world if it does not run.

### Step 3.8 (h) — Open questions

Anything the spec does not settle, including any role from Step 2.4 the IAM cannot express
and any policy from Step 2.8 with nothing seeded yet. Do not guess and do not build on a
guess.

Stop here. Wait for my approval before Step 4.1.

---

## §4 — Phase 3: backend, in layer order

Build strictly bottom-up. Each layer below is one step, and each step must be complete and
tested before the next one starts.

```
modules/[module_code]/
├── __init__.py  apps.py  contracts.py  registry.py  schedule.py  tasks.py
├── domain/          framework-free Python: rules, state machine, calculations
├── models/          Django models, one file per aggregate, package not module
├── selectors/        all reads, including scoping.py
├── services/         all writes, one file per use-case family
├── api/              views.py serializers.py urls.py (+ permissions.py, only if the
│                    module needs gate classes of its own)
├── management/commands/
├── migrations/
└── tests/
```

Layer rules, enforced by `.importlinter`. A module that is not registered there, or in the
settings, is a module CI **never checks** — so registering it is the first step, not the last.

### Step 4.0 — Register the module

Copy exactly what `placement` does, in each of these places, before writing any layer:

- `config/settings/base.py` — add `"modules.[module_code]"` to `DOMAIN_MODULES`
  (`nav_matches_routes.py` only checks modules listed there), and one entry in
  `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` for each `throttle_scope` your write endpoints use.
- `config/urls.py` — mount `api/v1/[module_code]/` on `modules.[module_code].api.urls`.
- `config/celery.py` — merge your `BEAT_SCHEDULE` and `TASK_ROUTES`, the way Placement's are.
- `client/src/app/registry.ts` — one `MODULE_REGISTRY` entry whose `code` equals
  `registry.MODULE["code"]`, with a static `import()` of your `routes`.
- `.importlinter` — add `modules.[module_code]` to `source_modules` of
  `modules-only-touch-contracts`; add its `models`, `services`, `selectors`, `api` and `domain`
  to that contract's `forbidden_modules`; add `modules.[module_code].domain` to
  `domain-is-pure-python`; and copy `placement-layers` as `[module_code]-layers`.
- `conftest.py` — only if the real `IamClient` grows a method your module needs (Step 5.1).

These lines are pre-approved, and so is one new entry in `client/e2e/accounts.ts` for each role
your browser tests need. So are the module's teaching-reference script under
`ops/docs/` (Step 7.6) and the regenerated files from Steps 7.1 and 7.2. Any other change
outside your module's own folders is not — name it and wait (§9).

### Step 4.1 — `domain/`

Imports no Django, no DRF, no Celery. Pure functions and dataclasses. It may raise plain
exceptions; the **service layer** translates them into `core.api.exceptions` types. Never
import `core.api.exceptions` from `domain/`.

### Step 4.2 — `models/`

May import `domain/`. No `ForeignKey` crosses a module boundary, ever
(`ops/checks/no_cross_module_fk.py`). Use `TimeStampedModel` / `UserScopedModel`. Every
index is named, declared in `Meta.indexes`, and matches a real query's filter and ordering —
an index no query uses is cost, and a query no index serves is a slow page later.

### Step 4.3 — `selectors/`

Returns querysets and read DTOs. No writes. `scoping.py` owns visibility and every list
endpoint starts from it.

### Step 4.4 — `services/`

Owns every write. Rules:

- One transactional choke point per state change. If there is a workflow, *all* movement
  goes through one function that takes `select_for_update`, refuses a terminal source
  state, refuses the wrong actor, writes the audit trail, and emits any ledger entry — in
  one transaction. Two paths into the same state is how the rules drift apart.
- Raise `DomainError` subclasses from `core/api/exceptions.py` with a `code=`. The message
  is read by a person at IIITDMJ; write it as a sentence that tells them what to do next.
- **Order the refusals deliberately.** When two checks can both fail, the one whose message
  is more useful goes first.

### Step 4.5 — `api/`

Transport only: parse, delegate, serialise. Two gates on every endpoint — the module grant
first, then the permission. Every endpoint carries an `@extend_schema` with a request and
response example, so the committed schema documents it. Never `except Exception: pass` —
or any `except` that swallows an error without handling it. Query parameters are hostile input: an unparseable `?year=abc`
is a **400, never a 500**.

### Step 4.6 — `registry.py`

As designed in Step 3.4. `nav_matches_routes.py` will fail CI if a nav entry has no client
route or a route has no nav entry. Three further rules, because the IAM now builds each
role's sidebar from that role alone:

- **Every nav item carries a `required_permission`.** An item without one appears for
  every role the module is granted to, which is how student screens reached an office.
- **`ROLE_GRANTS` is the visibility decision, not a convenience.** A role that should see
  none of your screens does not belong in it — granting it "so they can look" puts your
  module in their sidebar permanently.
- Icons come from the Phosphor set `Fusion-client` renders. A name from another icon pack
  draws a grey circle and nothing else. This repository's own `client/` only knows a few
  `Fa…` names, so here every Phosphor icon draws a circle — that is expected. Never switch to
  an `Fa…` name to make it look right here; it would break the real sidebar.

### Step 4.7 — `schedule.py`

Exports `BEAT_SCHEDULE` and `TASK_ROUTES`; register both in `config/celery.py`. Each module
owns its own timers so a module stays removable.

### Step 4.8 — Management commands

For anything an operator must do: seeding policy, a readiness check, a manual run of each
scheduled task. Never name a flag `--version` — it collides with Django's own and the
command becomes uninvokable at parser construction.

Comments: **single line only, and only where the reason is not obvious from the code.**
If it will not fit on one line it belongs in `docs/`. This applies to `#`, `//`, JSX
comments and docstrings alike. A docstring that restates the function name is noise.

---

## §5 — Phase 4: tests that would actually catch a bug

Mirror `modules/placement/tests/` — one file per concern, named for the concern.

### Step 5.1 — Set up how a test gets a principal

The suite runs with no network and no IAM: `conftest.py` gives you `stub_iam`, which swaps
the IAM client for an in-memory fake, and `make_session` / `make_principal`, which mint a
session carrying exactly the `permissions`, `modules`, `roles` and `active_role` you name.
You never seed the IAM to write a test, and a test that needs a running
`Fusion_System_Administrator` is a test written wrong.

That convenience is also the trap, so five rules come with it:

- **Every positive test needs its negative twin.** The fake hands out whatever permission
  set you ask for, so "the coordinator can review" proves nothing on its own. The test that
  matters is the principal *without* the code getting a 403.
- **Permission strings in a test are free-form text.** A typo'd code is granted by the fake
  and denied in production — the test passes and the feature is broken. Assert the codes
  your tests use are the ones `registry.PERMISSIONS` declares, in a test that fails when
  they drift apart.
- **Both gates, separately.** A principal with the module grant but not the permission, and
  one with the permission but not the module grant. They are different refusals and only
  one of them is usually implemented.
- **One test for the role switch**: a principal holding two designations must get the acting
  role's view only. That leak reached production once already.
- When the real `IamClient` grows a method, add it to `FakeIam` in the same commit. A fake
  that has drifted is worse than no fake, because the suite stays green while the seam moves.

### Step 5.2 — Write the ordinary case first, by name

Before the clever tests, write the one for the person the module is actually for: the
student who holds nothing but `student`, the employee with one posting, the row with no
optional fields set. Interesting accounts get tested because they are interesting; the
plain ones carry the traffic. A rule that reads "the first office they hold" looks right
against every account you built to exercise it and refuses every ordinary user in
production.

### Step 5.3 — Domain tests

With no database. Every branch of every rule.

### Step 5.4 — State machine tests

Assert that every illegal transition is *refused*, enumerated from the transition table
rather than hand-picked.

### Step 5.5 — Privilege escalation tests (`test_privilege_escalation.py`)

For each endpoint, a principal who should not reach it, asserting 403 or 404 as designed.

### Step 5.6 — Scoping isolation tests (`test_recruiter_isolation.py` is the model)

Person A must not see person B's rows, including through a filter, a search and an export.

### Step 5.7 — Concurrency tests

For anything that credits, allocates, or must happen once. Run real threads against the
real database. Green single-threaded tests prove nothing here — a double-credit bug in
the leave module this platform once had survived 631 passing tests and was only ever found
this way. Mark the test `django_db(transaction=True)` — the usual per-test transaction hides
each thread's writes from the others — release the threads together on a `threading.Barrier`
so they really overlap, and close each thread's database connection when it finishes.

### Step 5.8 — Query budget tests (`test_query_budgets.py`)

Assert a maximum query count per list endpoint so an N+1 fails CI instead of production.
Assert the **same** count with 2 rows and with 20: a generous ceiling measured at one size
hides an N+1.

### Step 5.9 — Schedule tests

Assert every beat entry your module registers is actually present in `config/celery.py`'s
merged schedule. Then run each task twice in a row, and twice at once, and assert it took
effect once: tasks here are acknowledged late and can be delivered again after a worker dies.

### Step 5.10 — Write down a refusal's excluded set

A refusal you add must name who it now refuses. When you introduce a check that fails
closed, write down the set it excludes and confirm each is meant to be excluded. Both of
this platform's fail-closed guards needed a floor: the one that refuses a mass
deactivation, and the one that decides an acting role. Fail closed on the unknown case,
not on the empty one.

### Step 5.11 — Adversarial pass

Before you tell me it is done, spend a deliberate pass trying to break your own module as a
malicious insider. Specifically ask: can an approver approve their own record? Can a thing
appear in its own approval queue? Can a balance go negative? Can something be back-dated
without limit? Can a required third party be someone who is themselves unavailable? Each of
those five was a real hole in an earlier module on this platform that its test suite did
not see. Then ask the questions your own module invites: can someone act on a row outside
their scope by sending its id directly? Can a closed, cancelled or rejected record still be
changed? Can the same request, sent twice, take effect twice? Every hole you find becomes a
test before it becomes a fix.

Error paths are tested, not assumed: for each endpoint, the refusal it can give — 401
without a session, 403 or 404 by design, 409 for a conflict with current state, 400 or 422
for invalid input, 429 when throttled.

### Step 5.12 — Journey tests: the backend end to end

`tests/test_journeys.py`: one test per live use case's main success scenario, and one per
alternate or exception flow the spec names. Each drives the module **only through HTTP** —
`APIClient`, with `make_session` for each actor in turn (the applicant submits, the approver
acts, the applicant sees the outcome) — against the real database, and asserts the response
bodies, the rows left behind and the audit trail. Name each test for its use-case id. Unit
tests prove the parts; these prove the module.

### Step 5.13 — Every live id has a test

Every live BR, UC, workflow and requirement id is cited by at least one test, in the test's
name or a one-line
comment on it, so `grep -rn '<ID>' modules/[module_code]/tests` finds it. A live id with no
test is a rule nobody has shown is enforced.

### Step 5.14 — Coverage is the floor

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest modules/[module_code] --cov=modules/[module_code] --cov-branch \
  --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=90
.venv/bin/pytest modules/[module_code] --cov=modules/[module_code]/domain --cov-branch \
  --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=95
```

Both must pass. Coverage measures the code under test only: if the report lists a file under
`tests/` or `migrations/`, the run is invalid — `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.coverage.run]`
leaves them out, so check it is on your branch. A `# pragma: no cover` needs a one-line reason a reviewer would accept, and a
covered line whose effect no test asserts is not tested — coverage is the floor, not the goal.

### Step 5.15 — Prove the tests can fail

Pick the five rules whose failure would hurt most — a scoping filter, a permission gate, a
balance or limit check, a state transition, a uniqueness constraint. For each: copy the file
somewhere outside the repository, break the enforcement on purpose (invert the condition,
drop the filter), run the suite, confirm a test that names that rule fails, then copy the
file back and confirm the suite is green again. Never use `git checkout`, `git stash` or
`git reset` for this — they throw away uncommitted work. List the five, and the test that caught each, in the quality report.
A rule you can break with the suite still green is untested, whatever the coverage says.

---

## §6 — Phase 5: frontend

`client/src/modules/[module_code]/`, matching `client/src/modules/placement/` exactly, plus
the page tests Placement does not have yet (Step 6.7):

```
api/types.ts        types mirroring the serializers
api/hooks.ts        TanStack Query hooks, one per endpoint
api/hooks.test.tsx
components/         module-specific components
pages/              one file per route, each with its own <Page>.test.tsx
routes.tsx          the route table nav_matches_routes.py reads
```

### Step 6.1 — Build pages, not an application

`Fusion-client` supplies the sidebar, the header, the role switcher and the profile. Your
module renders inside it, so it must not ship a second one of any of those — two shells
means icons, roles and sections kept in step twice, and they drift. Anything the portal
already owns (the student profile, the resume, the notification bell) is not yours to
reimplement.

### Step 6.2 — Use the shared HTTP client

Use the shared axios instance `client/src/lib/http.ts`. It already carries the session
cookie and the CSRF header. Do not create a second one.

### Step 6.3 — Render real empty and error states

Every page must render a real empty state and a real error state. "Loading…" forever when
the API 500s is a defect.

### Step 6.4 — Never render a control permissions do not allow

Navigation arrives from the server already filtered (ADR-0010), and the same must be true
inside the page. Hiding the sidebar link is not enough: anyone can type the URL, and that is
how Placement once showed students the office's "Register company" and "Schedule a round".

- **A page that is for some roles only is closed at its route.** Wrap it in
  `RequirePermission` with exactly its nav item's `required_permission`, the way the
  `office()` helper in Placement's `routes.tsx` does. A role without that permission gets
  `NotPermitted` and the page never mounts, so it fetches nothing either.
- **A page several roles share stays open and gates each control** with `can()` from
  `useAuth`, the way Placement's Postings page gates its manage controls.
- **Pin the guards with a test.** Copy `test_client_route_guards.py` for your module: it fails
  when a guarded page loses its guard or a guard drifts from its nav item's permission.
- The server stays the authority (Step 7.7): never rely on a hidden button to refuse an
  action, and never hide one the server would allow.

### Step 6.5 — Run the client gate before every commit

`make check-client` (`typecheck && test && build`) is this repo's actual client gate — run
it before every commit. There is no pre-commit hook here to bypass; `--no-verify` is a
`Fusion-client` habit and does nothing useful in this one.

### Step 6.6 — Confirm inside the real portal (`full-platform` only, once code is otherwise done)

Confirm the module framed inside the real portal, not only in this repo's own `client/`.
Add the sidebar entry from the blueprint's Step 3.5 (e) to `Fusion-client`'s
`INTEGRATED_MODULES`, open it there, and check the icon renders (Phosphor, not
`react-icons` — a name from the wrong set draws a grey circle) and that the role switcher
shows only what that role was granted.

### Step 6.7 — Test every page

Each page gets `pages/<Page>.test.tsx` covering five things: the loading state; the empty
state; the error state (the API answers 500 and the page shows a message, not a spinner); a
control the principal has no permission for is absent; and the page's main action (fill in,
submit, see the success or the server's refusal message). Mock at the HTTP boundary — the
shared axios instance — never inside your own hooks. Query by role and label (`getByRole`,
`getByLabelText`): if a test cannot find a control that way, neither can a screen reader.

### Step 6.8 — Typed, accessible and honest UI

- Every input has a visible label; every icon-only button has an `aria-label`.
- No `any`, `@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable` or `console.log` in the diff.
- No hard-coded sample data: every value on screen comes from the API.
- Client-side validation mirrors the server's for convenience only. The server stays the
  authority, and its refusal message is shown to the user as it was sent.

### Step 6.9 — Walk it in a real browser

With the backend, the IAM and `npm run dev` running, log in as one synthetic dump account for
each role in Step 3.4, and as the plain user, and carry every live use case's main flow
through end to end in the browser. Keep the browser console and the server log open: an
uncaught error, a 500, or a refusal that should not have happened is a defect. Do one flow
with the keyboard alone: every control reachable by Tab and usable with Enter or Space. Record
a table in the quality report — role, dump username, use case, result — and under each row
paste the `runserver` log lines for its requests. If you cannot drive a browser yourself,
mark the row "not run" and ask me to walk it; never fill in a result you did not see.

Then make each live use case's main flow a Playwright spec in `client/e2e/[module_code]/`, built
on the harness exactly as the E2E section of `docs/06-crosscutting/testing-strategy.md` says:
import `test` from `../support/test`; start signed in with `signedInAs`; act as the role with
`actAs`; reach screens through the sidebar; create the data the journey needs through the UI
with unique names; select by role and label. No `waitForTimeout`, no `test.only` or
`test.skip`. Run `make e2e` with the IAM and `make dev` running; every spec must pass, and the
walkthrough table names the spec that automates each row. For every route you guarded in
Step 6.4, add a spec that opens it directly as a role without the permission and expects
`NotPermitted` and no buttons, the way `office-pages.spec.ts` does. Never change
`client/playwright.config.ts`, `client/e2e/global-setup.ts`, `client/e2e/support/` or another
folder's specs — those are the harness, and a change there is a shared-file change (§9).

---

## §7 — Phase 6: ops, docs and the seams

### Step 7.1 — Regenerate and commit the API schema

`make schema` — regenerate and **commit** `openapi/fusion-integrated.v1.yaml`. CI diffs it.

### Step 7.2 — Regenerate and seed permissions

`make permissions` — regenerate `registry/permissions.json`, which the IAM seeds from.
Regenerating is half the job: the IAM only revokes a dropped grant when it is re-seeded
with `seed_iam_permissions --manifest <path>`. Run it from the IAM's checkout, as
`role-assignment-guide.md` Part 3 shows —
`cd <absolute path to Fusion_System_Administrator>/Backend/backend && ./../venv/bin/python manage.py
seed_iam_permissions --manifest /full/path/to/Fusion-Integrated/registry/permissions.json` —
and read what it says it revoked.

### Step 7.3 — Clear the deploy-check gate

`manage.py check --deploy --fail-level WARNING` runs in CI, so a security warning fails
the build. If your module needs a setting Django warns about, silence that one check by
id with the reason on the line above it — do not weaken the setting.

### Step 7.4 — Review migrations by hand

A data migration that backfills must be idempotent and must state what it does when run
against an empty table.

### Step 7.5 — Document and prove the deployment order

Deployment order must be documented and must work: `migrate` → your policy-seeding command
(if the module has one) → `seed_modules` → grants → your readiness command. `seed_modules` already calls your `registry.readiness()`, so that
function returns the list of **unmet prerequisites**, each a sentence saying what to do, and
your readiness command prints the same list. "Module is not ready" without saying why is not
acceptable.

### Step 7.6 — Write the module's docs

Write the module's docs under `docs/[NN]-[module_code]/`: domain model, state machine,
and whatever else has a genuine reader. Then write `ops/docs/[module_code]_reference.py`. It
generates `docs/[NN]-[module_code]/[module_code]-reference.md`, with one `file:line` link
from every live rule, use case, workflow and requirement id to the code that enforces it,
and exits non-zero if any link does not resolve. Commit both. Run the script as part of your
gates: afterwards `git status --porcelain` must print nothing, or the committed reference is
stale.

### Step 7.7 — Security self-audit

Go through every item and fix what fails; the reviewer will check each one.

- Every view sits behind both gates — the module grant, then the permission. No
  `AllowAny`, and no view reachable outside the module's router.
- Every serializer lists its `fields` explicitly — never `__all__` or `exclude` — and every
  server-owned field (status, owner `user_id`, approver, timestamps, ledger amounts) is
  read-only.
- Every list and detail read starts from `selectors/scoping.py`. Every id that arrives in a
  request body (a nominee, a related record) is checked against the caller's scope before it
  is used — an unchecked id is how one person acts on another's row.
- No raw SQL, `.extra()`, string-built queries, `eval`, `pickle`, `yaml.load` or
  `subprocess` on request data.
- File uploads, if any, go through `core/files`: size and type checked from the content,
  stored outside the web root, served only by a view that checks permission and scope.
- Every write endpoint carries a `throttle_scope`.
- Logs carry ids, never names, roll numbers, tokens or request bodies.
- No error response carries a stack trace, SQL or a file path.
- No view overrides `authentication_classes` or `permission_classes` to loosen them. A
  cookie-authenticated write without the `X-CSRF-Token` header answers 403, and a test
  proves it.
- In the client: no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no token in `localStorage`, every call
  through `lib/http.ts`.
- No new Python or npm dependency without my approval. If one is approved, `pip-audit` /
  `npm audit --audit-level=high` must be clean for it.
- The deploy check passes with production settings, exactly as CI runs it:
  ```bash
  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.prod DB_PASSWORD=local-check-only \
  DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=local-check-only-key-long-enough-to-satisfy-the-length-check \
  DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=local.invalid IAM_SERVICE_TOKEN=local \
  PLACEMENT_UPLOAD_ROOT=/tmp/check-uploads \
  REDIS_CACHE_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1 REDIS_BROKER_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6380/0 \
  .venv/bin/python manage.py check --deploy --fail-level WARNING
  ```
  If your module adds a setting that production requires, add it to that line and to CI's
  "Deployment checks" step. That is a shared-file change: name it and wait (§9).

### Step 7.8 — Prove a fresh install, start to finish

§8 item 4, done for real on a throwaway database, never on your working one. Run this as
**one** shell command, with `DB_NAME` on every line: an exported variable does not survive
from one tool call to the next, and a `make migrate` that has lost it migrates your working
database instead.

```bash
docker compose exec -T db dropdb -U fusion_admin --if-exists fusion_integrated_fresh && \
docker compose exec -T db createdb -U fusion_admin fusion_integrated_fresh && \
DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh make migrate && \
DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh .venv/bin/python manage.py migrate [module_code] zero && \
DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh make migrate && \
DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh .venv/bin/python manage.py seed_modules && \
DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh .venv/bin/python manage.py <your readiness command>
```

If your `readiness()` can report anything, the readiness command must name what is missing
at this point. Seed the IAM from `make permissions` as in
Step 7.2 and grant one test account its role. Then run, again as one command with
`DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh` on every line, your policy-seeding command (if the module
has one), `seed_modules` and the readiness command: readiness must pass, and `seed_modules`
must print no "NOT active" warning. Then ask the person running this session to stop `make dev`, start
`DB_NAME=fusion_integrated_fresh make dev`, perform the first user action in the browser and
paste you the `runserver` lines for it. When that is done, they restart `make dev` normally
and you drop the database:

```bash
docker compose exec -T db dropdb -U fusion_admin --if-exists fusion_integrated_fresh
```

Paste the real output of each step, and the pasted log lines, into the quality report.

### Step 7.9 — Write the quality report

`docs/[NN]-[module_code]/[module_code]-quality-report.md` is the evidence a reviewer and the
maintainer read first. It holds, each with the command and the real output's last lines:

1. `make check` and `make check-client`.
2. Both coverage runs from Step 5.14, with the totals.
3. Test counts per file, and the journey tests mapped to their use-case ids.
4. The five broken-on-purpose rules from Step 5.15 and the test that caught each.
5. The adversarial pass (Step 5.11): each question asked, what you found, what you changed.
6. The security self-audit (Step 7.7), item by item.
7. The fresh-install proof (Step 7.8).
8. The browser walkthrough table (Step 6.9).
9. Every scheduled task run by hand, and what it changed.
10. Known gaps that were accepted, each with its spec id, the reason and the approval record.
11. Every approval this prompt required — the blueprint, each gap, each shared-file change,
    each dependency — as a link to, or dated quote of, the written approval.
12. The scorecard of every review round except the last (§10), each with the commit it
    reviewed. The last round's scorecard goes in the pull request description, because
    committing it would be a change after the review.

It names no AI tool and contains no production data. It is the module's record, not a
diary of the session.

### Step 7.10 — Rebase and regenerate before the pull request

Before the round they expect to be the last, the person running this session rebases onto the
latest `main` — you never run `git rebase`, or any command that rewrites history. A rebase is
a change, and a review only counts for the commit it saw. Never hand-merge a generated file —
`openapi/fusion-integrated.v1.yaml`, `registry/permissions.json`,
`docs/02-iam/permission-catalog.generated.md` — take `main`'s version and regenerate it
(`make schema`, `make permissions`). While your module has never been merged, keep its
migrations to one clean initial set: first `.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate [module_code]
zero` so your database forgets them, then delete your own unmerged migration files and run
`makemigrations` once. Then run every gate again: a rebase is a change.

### Changing anything on a running server

These are not steps in the module's own sequence; they are how this platform has actually
broken, and they apply any time this phase touches a live service. Each one cost hours on
the day it was learned.

- **Find out what the process loads before you edit a file.** `systemctl show <unit> -p
  Environment` and the unit's `ExecStart` are the only authority. This platform's portal
  runs a settings module in `/etc/fusion` that imports `development.py`, so every edit to
  `production.py` was inert — three rounds of downtime before anybody checked.
- **A service being up is not the service working.** `systemctl status` reported `active
  (running)` while the IAM held a placeholder where its password should be, because the
  master process starts fine and the failure is per request. Verify with a request and read
  the status code. Where the service listens on a unix socket, `curl --unix-socket`; a port
  you assumed is a port you have not checked.
- **Say the rollback out loud before you make the change**, and keep it to one line. A copy
  of the file you are about to replace, taken first, is usually the whole plan.
- **A credential more than one service uses changes everywhere in one pass.** Rotating the
  database role broke the portal and the IAM at different minutes because they were updated
  separately; each looked like a fresh incident. List every consumer first — unit files,
  every `.env`, `.pgpass` — then change them together.
- **Never paste a real secret into a command you did not write yourself.** A placeholder
  copied literally put `<new password>` into a live config, and the test that should have
  caught it used the same placeholder, so it "failed" for the wrong reason and sent the
  diagnosis sideways.

## §8 — Definition of done

Not "tests pass". All of it:

1. `make check` green — including `lint-imports`, the three `ops/checks/` scripts,
   `permission_manifest --check` and `schema-check`.
2. `make check-client` green — **wait for `tsc` to finish**; reading `npm test` output
   early has shipped a broken typecheck here before.
3. Every live spec id from Phase 0 is either implemented and cited at its enforcement point,
   or listed in the blueprint as a known gap with a reason. **No retired id is cited
   anywhere in the code.**
4. The module can be turned on from nothing: fresh database → migrate → seed → grant →
   first user action succeeds. Prove it by doing it, not by reasoning about it.
5. The adversarial pass in Step 5.11 is done and its findings are either fixed or written
   down.
6. Every scheduled task has been run manually once and its effect observed.
7. No comment longer than one line anywhere in the diff.
8. No AI attribution anywhere — not in code, comments, commit messages, PR bodies or docs.
   All work is committed under my own GitHub identity.
9. No production data — no roll numbers, names or person ids — in any commit message, PR
   body, issue or doc.
10. **No credential in a file the repository tracks** — not a password, key, token or app
    password, not "temporarily", not with a comment saying to change it later. They are read
    from the environment. The legacy portal shipped a database password, a mail password and
    a `SECRET_KEY` this way, and the key signed production's session cookies while sitting in
    a public repo for anyone to read.
11. **The plain user is tested**, not only the one with an interesting set of roles. Step
    5.2's rule.
12. Journey tests for every live use case (Step 5.12); every live id cited by a test (Step
    5.13); both coverage gates pass (Step 5.14); five rules broken on purpose and caught
    (Step 5.15).
13. Every page tested for its five states (Step 6.7), the module's chunk in `npm run build`
    output at or under 150 kB gzip, and the browser walkthrough done for every role and the
    plain user, with one flow done by keyboard alone, and no console error and no 500
    (Step 6.9). Every live use case's main flow is a Playwright spec in
    `client/e2e/[module_code]/`, every guarded route has its deep-link spec, and `make e2e`
    passes.
14. The security self-audit (Step 7.7) passes item by item, and the fresh install (Step 7.8)
    has been proved by doing it.
15. The quality report (Step 7.9) exists and every number in it came from a run made after
    the last code change.
16. §10's review scores 10 in all nine dimensions, from a review made after the last change —
    or, after round 7, the mentor's written ruling on whatever is still open.

## §9 — Standing rules for this session

- **Do not commit, push, or open a PR until I explicitly say so.** An instruction to do it
  once does not carry forward to the next piece of work.
- Do not touch `Fusion/FusionIIIT/Fusion/settings/common.py` or anything in the legacy
  Fusion app. Only the active modules are in scope.
- **Your module is `modules/[module_code]/`, `client/src/modules/[module_code]/`, its own
  tests and its own doc folder — nothing else is yours by default.** A change to `core/`, to
  another module, to a shared config file, or to CI itself may be genuinely necessary; when
  it is, name the file and the reason and wait, the same as any other approval gate here. Do
  not fold it into the same commit as your module unasked, however small it looks.
- Do not claim something works because a test is green. Run it, look at the result, and
  report what you actually saw — including the parts that failed.
- If a spec rule and the platform's architecture genuinely conflict, stop and tell me.
  Do not resolve it silently in either direction.
- If you find yourself about to write "this should probably…", that is an open question for
  Step 3.8 (h), not a decision.

## §10 — Review until it is 10/10

You do not score your own work. Read [`module-review-prompt.md`](module-review-prompt.md)
before you start Phase 3 — it is the bar, and building to it from the first line is cheaper
than retrofitting it — but the score itself always comes from somewhere else.

### Step 10.1 — Say it is ready, with the evidence

When you believe §8 holds, finish the quality report (Step 7.9) and stop. Tell me it is ready
for review, and list anything in §8 you could not do yourself. A review only reads committed
code, so I commit the work locally — not push — before every round; you do not commit.

### Step 10.2 — The review happens outside this session

I run `module-review-prompt.md` in a fresh session that has never seen this one — ideally on a
different model. It re-runs every gate itself, scores nine dimensions from 0 to 10, and
returns numbered findings, each with a file and line, the rule it breaks and what done looks
like.

### Step 10.3 — Fix every finding, then re-run everything

When I paste the findings here, fix every one. Fix the cause, not the symptom: a finding that
a check is missing in one view means checking every view for the same gap. Then re-run **every**
gate — not only the ones your fix touched — update the quality report, and go back to Step
10.1. If you disagree with a finding, do not skip it silently: say why, with evidence, and I
decide.

### Step 10.4 — When it is finished

The module is finished when a review made **after the last code change** scores 10 in all
nine dimensions. Any change after that review — even a one-line fix — needs a new review. If
the same finding comes back three rounds in a row, stop and tell me: that is a disagreement
about the spec or the architecture, and it is mine to settle, not yours to keep patching.
After round 7, the mentor's written ruling on whatever is still open replaces the 10/10.
