"""The facts an eligibility rule is evaluated against.

Each has one owner: academic facts from the IAM's declared-CPI projection,
identity from its directory, placement state from this module, skills from the
student's profile.

Gathered in a fixed number of queries however many students are asked about,
and fail-closed — a student with no declared result has no academic facts, and
the engine denies on a missing fact rather than reading absence as zero.
