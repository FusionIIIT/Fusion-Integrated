"""Post-offer obligations: the signed offer letter and non-joining (rules 22, 24).

Rule 24 makes this module the gate on a no-dues certificate, which is the one
place placement can block a student's graduation paperwork. So the answer names
the company still owing a letter rather than returning a bare "blocked", and
`contracts.get_no_dues_clearances` exposes it to the rest of the platform
without anyone reaching into these tables.
