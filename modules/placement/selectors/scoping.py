"""Role scope, decided in one place (PC-UC-018).

Every list and detail view starts from a queryset built here. Ownership is
enforced by narrowing the queryset, never by fetching a row and then checking
it — so a row you may not see is a 404, not a 403. A 403 would confirm it
exists, which for placement data is itself a disclosure.

    PC-BR-009  a company sees only applications to its own postings
    PC-BR-010  the TPO sees everything in the module
    PC-BR-016  students get anonymised aggregates, not raw records
    PC-BR-019  alumni get a narrow read-only slice
    PC-BR-020  alumni are excluded from active workflow objects
    PC-BR-023  sensitive data is restricted to authorised readers
