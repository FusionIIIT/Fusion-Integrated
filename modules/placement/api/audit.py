"""Reading the audit trail (PC-BR-008).

Two records: every application state change, and every conduct incident.

What each caller sees differs, and the difference is deliberate.

  * **Staff** see everything, including who acted and the free-text reason.
  * **A student** sees their own timeline — what happened and when — but not the
    reason and not who acted. The reason field has never been shown to students
    (the notification says only that the status changed), so surfacing it now
    would expose notes written on the understanding they were internal. Naming
    the TPO who rejected someone also invites pressure on that person.
  * **A recruiter** sees the timeline for applications to their own postings,
    with institute actors unnamed for the same reason.

A student DOES see their own conduct record in full, reason included: rule 21
puts a sanction at the Chairperson's discretion and rule 19 allows a waiver, and
nobody can contest what they cannot read.
